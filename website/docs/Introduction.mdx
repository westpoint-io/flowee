# Introduction

Flowee is a command-line tool that helps you visualize CloudFormation templates as React Flow diagrams. This allows you to quickly
understand the structure, dependencies, and potential issues within your templates.

## Here's how it works:

- **Send your CloudFormation template:** Use the flowee generate-diagram command followed by the path to your template file (e.g., flowee
  generate-diagram --cf template.json).

- **Visualization magic:** Flowee processes the template and generates a React Flow diagram that clearly represents the resources and their
  connections.

- **Explore your diagram:** The diagram opens in your web browser, allowing you to navigate and inspect the different components of your
  CloudFormation template.

## Benefits of using Flowee:

- **Improved understanding:** Visualizing your CloudFormation templates makes them easier to grasp, especially for complex configurations.
- **Early issue detection:** Identify potential errors or inefficiencies within your templates before deployment.
- **Enhanced collaboration:** Share the generated diagrams with your team for better communication and collaboration.
